As basic as it sounds I created a Add/Remove vuejs app to learn more about VueX state management.

  - SemanticUI
  - Handlebars Templating
  - Magic

# You can:
  - Create URLs
  - Delete a URL

   I woke up this morning and After finishing up the Redis app  I thought i  jumped on this project Vuejs ASAP I knew the basics but i wanted to learn about what I perceived as the hard stuff. State management. more of a muscle memory honer today as i got into mutations, actions , basic getters & setters and mapState,mapActions. 

I thought about why the developers @ Vue make the naming spread out and vague mapState..
